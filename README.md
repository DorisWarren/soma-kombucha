## Setup/Installation Requirements
* _Clone this repository grom Github_
* _Run `git clone` in your terminal of choice_
* _$ cd `soma-kombucha`_
* _Navigate to the folder inside your terminal and run `npm install`_
* _After the install is complete you can run `npm run start` to see a live version of the website._

## Development Notes 
* _When starting off, REACT has a more minimlist approach.Which is fine, you are able to add additional libraies based upon your needs. Angular provides a lot more features like `@angular/router` and `@angular/forms`._ 
* _Uses `JSX`, on top of JavaScript. Along with `State Managment` and `PropTypes`.(Still TRYING to understand this)._
* _Styling is a lot more complicated with React. This past week, I felt styling with REACT was a bit more complicated. I figured out an easier way to implement styling!
